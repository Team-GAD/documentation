## Cheers Documentation

This project was created during the Master Internship **“Edge Computing and the Internet of Things (IN2106, IN4261)”** at the Technical University of Munich. 

The following documentation is intended to describe the individual components of the project and to enable someone with technical knowledge to understand the project and build it themselves.

The entire source code can be viewed in the [GitHub repository]('https://github.com/Team-GAD') 
as well as the final documentation and all presentations and diagrams created during the project.
